      <strong>Event:</strong> During the project review meeting, my manager
      questioned my workload in front of others and stated that I “wasn’t keeping
      up,” despite prior approval for reduced duties under medical accommodation.

      summarizing the exchange and requesting clarification of approved
      accommodations.

        HR is not your therapist. HR protects the company. Use internal channels on
        purpose, with receipts.
      </p>

      <ol class="numbered-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Decide the goal.</strong> Do you want the behavior to stop, a
          transfer, documentation for the record, or all of the above? Knowing this
          shapes what you say.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow written policy.</strong> Most handbooks spell out how to
          report harassment, discrimination, or safety issues. Following that path
          helps later if the company ignores it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use email, not just conversations.</strong> After meetings, send
          recap emails: “Per our conversation today, my understanding is…”. This
          locks in what was said.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be factual, not emotional.</strong> You can be firm without
          venting. Stick to dates, quotes, and impacts on your work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Save everything.</strong> Screenshots, emails, Teams/Slack
          messages, performance reviews, seating charts, policy PDFs.

        <strong>Important:</strong> If you feel unsafe or targeted after reporting,

          <p>
            Individual HR people can care about you as a human, but HR’s legal
            duty is to the company. Treat HR as a channel, not your protector.
            Use them, document them, don’t rely on them emotionally.

          <p>
            Leaving might protect your health, but quitting can affect claims and

            documentation before you go.

            Recording laws are very different by state and country. Some require
            just one person to know about the recording, others require everyone’s
            consent. Check your local law before recording anyone.

  <h2>About the Creator</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    This site wasn’t written by HR. It was written by someone who’s survived HR.
    I’ve sat through the “open door” meetings, the “we value transparency” speeches,
    and the “we take all complaints seriously” emails that never went anywhere.

        I’m <strong>Keisha Ruffner</strong> — just another employee who had to learn
        how to document, protect, and keep her sanity inside a system designed to make
        you question your memory. When HR says “we’re neutral,” it usually means
        “we’re collecting information for management.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I built <strong>Open Door Policy</strong> so regular workers have a place to
        learn how the system really works — and how to work around it. Because your
        performance review shouldn’t double as an interrogation transcript.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t legal advice. It’s a survival guide.
