      up,” despite prior approval for reduced duties under medical accommodation.

        HR is not your therapist. HR protects the company. Use internal channels on
        purpose, with receipts.
      </p>

      <ol class="numbered-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Decide the goal.</strong> Do you want the behavior to stop, a
          transfer, documentation for the record, or all of the above? Knowing this
          shapes what you say.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow written policy.</strong> Most handbooks spell out how to
          report harassment, discrimination, or safety issues. Following that path
          helps later if the company ignores it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use email, not just conversations.</strong> After meetings, send
          recap emails: “Per our conversation today, my understanding is…”. This
          locks in what was said.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be factual, not emotional.</strong> You can be firm without
          venting. Stick to dates, quotes, and impacts on your work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Save everything.</strong> Screenshots, emails, Teams/Slack
          messages, performance reviews, seating charts, policy PDFs.

        <strong>Important:</strong> If you feel unsafe or targeted after reporting,

          <p>
            Individual HR people can care about you as a human, but HR’s legal
            duty is to the company. Treat HR as a channel, not your protector.
            Use them, document them, don’t rely on them emotionally.

          <p>
            Leaving might protect your health, but quitting can affect claims and

            Recording laws are very different by state and country. Some require
            just one person to know about the recording, others require everyone’s
            consent. Check your local law before recording anyone.

<p class="section-intro">
  This site wasn’t written by a lawyer. It was written by someone who has

      I’m a longtime employee who had to learn the hard way how to document,
      push back, and survive inside systems that were never designed to
      safeguard workers. I know what it feels like to be isolated, discredited,
      or quietly punished for speaking the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I built <strong>WorkShield</strong> so no one else has to start from zero.
      You deserve clear language, practical steps, and scripts you can actually
      use on the days when you’re too tired to explain yourself again. This
      guide exists to remind you that documentation is not defiance — it’s
      protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>not</strong> an attorney, and this site does
      <strong>not</strong> provide legal advice. It’s a worker-to-worker
      resource grounded in lived experience, research, and the shared goal of
      holding toxic workplaces accountable — one documented fact at a time.
